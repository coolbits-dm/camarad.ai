    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> 12 February 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Parties and acceptance</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms govern your access to and use of Camarad.ai (the "Service"), operated by
      <strong>COOL BITS S.R.L.</strong> ("we", "us").
      By creating an account, signing in, or using the Service, you agree to these Terms.
      If you do not agree, do not use the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Account and authentication</h2>
    <p>
      Access to the Service requires authentication. Sign-in may be provided via Google OAuth through
      Coolbits infrastructure. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account
      and for all activity under your account.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Client/workspace scoping</h2>
    <p>
      The Service supports workspaces and client contexts. You must only access data you are authorized to access.
      You may not attempt to bypass scoping, view other users'/clients' data, or exploit any isolation mechanism.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-party services and connectors</h2>
    <p>
      The Service can connect to third-party services (for example Google services such as Ads and GA4).
      When you connect an external account, you authorize the Service to access and process data from that account
      within the permissions you grant. You remain responsible for your compliance with third-party terms.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Usage, runs, and outputs</h2>
    <p>
      The Service may execute workflows ("runs"), generate traces, summaries, and AI-assisted outputs.
      Outputs can be incomplete, incorrect, or unsuitable for your use-case. You are responsible for reviewing
      outputs before acting on them.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Acceptable use</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not use the Service for illegal activities.</li>
      <li>Do not interfere with, disrupt, or attempt unauthorized access to any systems or data.</li>
      <li>Do not upload or transmit malware, exploits, or abusive traffic.</li>
      <li>Do not attempt to extract secrets, tokens, or credentials from the Service or connected systems.</li>
      <li>Do not use the Service to violate privacy, confidentiality, or intellectual property rights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Intellectual property</h2>
    <p>
      The Service and its software, UI, and content are protected by applicable intellectual property laws.
      You receive a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the Service according to these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Availability and changes</h2>
    <p>
      The Service may be updated, modified, or discontinued at any time. We may introduce limits or restrictions
      to protect stability and security.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Suspension and termination</h2>
    <p>
      We may suspend or terminate access if we reasonably believe you violated these Terms, compromised security,
      or created risk for other users or the Service. You may request account deletion by contacting us.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>
      The Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. To the maximum extent permitted by law,
      we disclaim warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential,
      or punitive damages, or for loss of profits, data, or goodwill, arising from your use of the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Governing law</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms are governed by the laws of Romania. Disputes will be handled by the competent courts
      in Romania, unless mandatory consumer protection law provides otherwise.
