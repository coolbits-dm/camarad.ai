Across industries and regions, the competitive environment today is far more unpredictable than it was even a decade ago, with disruption arising from all directions. Digitization and globalization are blurring the lines between sectors as well as between traditional competitor groups. Technology is changing consumer behavior, empowering startups, making pricing more transparent, and reducing product life cycles. Today’s global economy, characterized by rapid growth in emerging markets and slower growth in developed countries, forces companies to develop unique strategies for each environment. Additionally, compa- nies must rethink—and continually reassess—their operational foot- print, owing to changing costs, evolving demand, and unfolding trade restrictions.

These leaders are constantly pushing themselves to aim higher, grow faster, and develop new business models and new ways of working. Even when their companies are performing well, these leaders are setting their ambitions higher. If companies are to respond effectively to these shifts and to realize the ambitions they have set for themselves, business as usual with incremen- tal improvements alone will not get the job done; they need to trans- form. A transformation is a profound change in strategy, business model, organization, people, and processes—either enterprise-wide or within a specific business unit, function, or market.

Funding the journey entails pulling short-term levers to establish momentum and free up capital to fuel new growth initiatives. Companies in transformation typically seek to quickly raise revenue, simplify the organization, use capital more efficiently, and reduce costs. Critically, these measures deliver rapid results to the bottom line; they also energize the organization and generate buy-in from managers and employees. - Winning in the Medium Term. Once the company has taken steps to fund the journey, it must make a more profound change to its legacy operations and business model. Winning in the medium term requires dramatically rethinking the company’s operating and business models to increase its competitive advantage. A critical component of this is rethinking the operating model—essentially rewiring the way the company delivers products and services to its customers.", "metadata": {"source_file": "BCG-Transformation-Nov-2016.pdf", "chunk_index": 11, "total_chunks": 251, "timestamp": "2026-02-04T07:47:49.865182"}}

The new business model may include an innovative go-to-market approach, a new digital business to complement or compete with legacy operations, or the launch of new tech or digital ventures. - Organizing for Sustained Performance. The third key element of a transformation is the people needed to sustain the transformation. Without a strong focus on the company’s team, organization, and culture, the transformation will fail. Senior executives need to commit to the initiative and lead from the front. HR needs to serve as a partner in the transformation, in part by identifying critical roles needed and developing the talent to fill those roles. Change manage- ment tools can help implement specific changes and track progress on the overall effort.

Over time, as the effort takes root, the priorities typically shift toward winning in the medium term.

BCG has developed a set of more formal screens that a company can use to assess its starting position. One such screen entails assessing the company’s overall performance in two dimensions: financial and strategic.

As Exhibit 4 shows, plotting a company along these two dimensions puts it in one of four boxes. Companies in any of the four boxes can benefit from transformation. The most obvious candidates are those with poor financial performance, which may need immediate steps to boost liquidity before taking longer-term measures such as rethinking their business and operating models or establishing the right processes, organization, and technology for sustaining improved performance. However, even successful companies with excellent financial perfor- mance will often need to take heed of changing market conditions and reshape the strategy by which they create value for shareholders.

Regardless of where a company starts, it should have clear goals in mind. Many leaders still believe that transformations are primarily about cutting costs. While cost reduction is usually a critical component of transforma- tion, given the wide range of starting points and goals, many types of transformation go well beyond cost reduction. Exhibit 5 lists some of the more common transformation types and the initiatives that they comprise. These are not mutually exclusive, and companies may combine or alter them depending on their specific situation and objectives. The specific objectives will vary by company, but common to all transformations is the objective to establish a funda- mentally different competitive position, leading to a step change in performance.

Typical quick wins include improving customer targeting, renegotiating accounts, managing discounts in a disciplined way, and optimizing promotions. For example, an automotive manufacturer undergoing a large-scale transformation was facing a decrease in demand and an increase in competition. Aftermarket pricing was one of many levers the company used to boost revenue. By implementing a systemic pricing model for its service business, the company was able, within one year, to improve its competitiveness at the parts level, leading to an increase of 4% in the weighted-average price it could charge and a 10% increase in total EBIT.

Fortunately, more tools and models are available to help marketers improve their marketing performance than ever before. In our experi- ence, however, no tool or model is sufficient on its own. Achieving substantial positive results requires pulling levers across the strategic, tactical, and operational levels to create a common currency of market- ing performance and the capability to measure it consistently across brands, products, locations, and campaigns over time.

For example, a global industrial-engineering company had piled up inventory for years as a result of market volatility. It needed to reverse that trend, especially because financing costs had risen drastically. It tailored quick-win actions for each plant while a small team worked to strategically reduce inventory and optimize raw-material stocks across plants. After only one year, the company had realized a $450 million cash release through a 35% reduction in total inventory.

Moreover, a deeper analysis of fixed assets can also yield dramatic improvements in capital efficiency. In addition to asset reduction options—such as an outright sale or a defunding of future capital outlays—best-in-class companies manage both the need for assets and the way that assets are utilized. Asset needs can be lowered by reducing the complexity in both the product portfolio and the customer base. A complex portfolio of products often requires broad manufacturing assets, along with ramp-ups, ramp-downs, and changeovers. Streamlin- ing the portfolio of products or customer accounts and rethinking outsourcing decisions can quickly improve productivity and allow for a reduction of assets.

Cost Reduction Targeted measures to cut costs are an essential component of a transfor- mation, yielding reductions of 10% to 25% in the cost base.

The company launched an effort to eliminate some positions, reduce management layers, and simplify the organization. Through these measures, the company closed the SG&A gap with its peer group in less than six months and restored its EBIT competitiveness. Nonpersonnel cost (NPC) reductions also improve overhead. Roughly 50% of overhead costs do not come from labor but are fodder for NPC reductions of 10% to 30%.

The specific objec- tives will vary by company, but common to all transformations is the need to establish a fundamentally different competitive position, leading to a medium-term step change in performance. Winning in the medium term could entail a wide range of initiatives to transform, including spurring growth, launching a new digital business model, or identifying and scaling up technology solutions through joint ventures. But it can also involve revamping commercial processes or operations, building digital capabilities and ventures, and transforming internal support functions such as R&D, IT, and HR. Compared with funding-the-journey measures, initiatives to win in the medium term are typically more difficult to conceptualize, because they require breakthrough thinking, usually in areas that are less familiar to the organization. It takes longer to deliver results from these initiatives, which are also harder to staff and implement. They call for managing interdependencies across functions and business units.", "metadata": {"source_file": "BCG-Transformation-Nov-2016.pdf", "chunk_index": 45, "total_chunks": 251, "timestamp": "2026-02-04T07:47:49.866865"}}

These choices determine the field of play, but, once made, they require additional decisions about where a business will invest to win on the field. In our experience, companies that have achieved significant growth have been diverse in their starting positions and strategic choices, but they have all followed common disciplines. Among our clients, we have found these lessons on how to grow apply nearly universally: - The nature, number, and risk profile of growth initiatives cannot be set without a clear view of the gap the company is trying to close. The start of any successful growth strategy requires an honest and rigorous assessment of the growth of all current initiatives, a clear objective for growth, and quantification of the gap between them over the target timeline. - In addition to the effort spent looking outward at the marketplace, companies need to look inward at their unique advantages and 30 The Boston Consulting Group capabilities.

New perspectives can upend long-standing beliefs about “stagnant cores” or “distant adjacencies.” Often, faint signals lost in the noise of today’s core business suggest opportunities. And unat- tractive adjacencies can become attractive when they are paired with an acquired capability or when they can create value by reinforcing the core. - For many companies, finding growth ideas is less difficult than focusing on the ones that matter. We like to ask three questions about all growth ideas: What is the size of the prize? What is our right to win? And what is the path to success?

The best organiza- tions also enable us to find meaning in our work. As organizations transform, leaders need to ensure that they are truly enabling the people working within those organizations to contribute, to grow, to find meaning, and to be more productive. Though organizations have a profound impact on people, and vice versa, companies launch far too many transformations with inadequate attention to the importance of people. Transformations are extraordi- narily demanding efforts, in which people need to go above and beyond the call of duty to deliver and sustain improved performance. And in the era of always-on transformation, where organizations constantly need to adapt, the demands can be even greater. Rather than feeling inspired and energized, people involved in transformations instead feel exhaust- ed. This need not be the case and surely will not yield the kind of sustainable results that leaders seek. The starting point is to stop treating people as a means to an end—or, worse, as collateral damage—and instead start putting people first.", "metadata": {"source_file": "BCG-Transformation-Nov-2016.pdf", "chunk_index": 69, "total_chunks": 251, "timestamp": "2026-02-04T07:47:49.868000"}}

But organizations do things that make it even harder—and more exhausting for people—than it Organizing for Sustained Performance 43 needs to be. Often, leaders try to motivate people through carrots and sticks (mostly sticks). Far too often, leaders expect people to perform at higher levels while working in an environment that does not foster and enable higher performance on a sustainable basis. Given these obstacles, how can leaders transform organizations so that their people feel empowered and energized? Success requires understanding the company’s organizational context— the environment in which people work.

A thoughtful diagnostic at the start of the transformation journey to identify areas of strength and weakness among these contextual ele- ments can help. With the insights thus generated, leaders can focus on the specific areas that require attention. It could be that the organiza- tion’s direction has not been effectively set, and the organization may lack purpose or clarity in its strategy or transformation agenda. Even if the direction is well established, there may be weaknesses in the leaders’ ability to convey and embody that direction. Alternatively, the organizational design may be inconsistent, with poorly defined roles or unclear decision rights. Or the organization may be weak on aligning its performance management systems to enable its strategy or not staffing the right talent in the right roles.

Collaboration also provides the connec- tions that allow different parts of an organization to work together effectively; forums, councils, and cross-functional teams are reliable mechanisms for fostering this collaboration.

Getting decision making right can unlock the power and necessary speed of a transformational effort. Build critical capabilities. Companies are increasingly embarking on transformations that rewire the way they operate—including new business models, digitization, and fundamental changes to the roles of business units and functions. As a result, companies invariably need to build new capabilities. Knowing how to identify and develop these capabilities in any given transformation is pivotal to success.", "metadata": {"source_file": "BCG-Transformation-Nov-2016.pdf", "chunk_index": 88, "total_chunks": 251, "timestamp": "2026-02-04T07:47:49.868855"}}

For example, a company seeking to become better at innovation may need additional capabilities in con- ducting primary research, developing products, assessing the market potential of new ideas, building a business case, and getting new products to market quickly. To build these capabilities, the company may need to improve its understanding of changes in customer behavior.

However, a holistic ap- proach to managing change—one that involves leaders at all levels, engages the broader organization, and ensures a high level of confi- dence in initiative delivery—can powerfully flip the odds in favor of success. To begin, it is important to establish an initiative roadmap for each of the many high-impact initiatives required to fund the journey and win in the medium term.

This entails a qualitative assessment of the robustness and consis- tency of each plan that ultimately addresses three important areas: - Is the initiative roadmap clearly defined, logically structured, and readily implementable? - Is the financial impact at each step clearly identified, along with the source, timing, and leading indicators? - Are interdependencies and other risks identified and understood? Analysis has shown that roadmaps whose rigor test earned “excellent” scores captured an average of 130% of their planned value.

Next, an activist PMO, one that closely supports senior leaders and the transformation agenda, has time and time again proved critical in enabling and facilitating impact across the business—particularly for cross-business initiatives. The value of getting the PMO right cannot be understated. Only one-third of PMO leaders feel that their PMO has realized its full potential to enable change within the organization. (See Strategic Initiative Management: The PMO Imperative, BCG and Project Management Institute report, 2015.) When used correctly, the PMO helps the leadership team maintain an appropriate pace of change and acts as the steward of the aspiration for change, ensuring that there is a clear line of sight to senior executives regarding imple- mentation progress and any emerging issues. At the same time, it must never usurp the authority of the business units or functions in deliver- ing results.

(See Changing Change Management: A Blueprint That Takes Hold, BCG report, December 2012.) Finally, rather than rolling out each new transformation initiative from scratch—and moving temporary scaffolding around the organization for each—companies should consider setting up an internal transformation office to embed change management in the organization. Companies with a permanent transformation office have dedicated resources to, and institutional expertise in, all aspects of change management, which they can deploy as needed. Properly structured, a transformation office can provide oversight of all transformation efforts, help prioritize and sequence transformations, design individual transformation initiatives, and track progress.

Install an HR team as a strategic transformation partner. All of the aforementioned imperatives have enormous implications for a compa- ny’s organization design, people practices, and HR policies.

Ultimately, HR needs to participate actively in senior leadership discussions, help develop the company’s strategy and transformation agenda, and support the align- ment of specific functions with the company’s priorities. To embrace this role, HR needs to evolve beyond its traditional supporting function to become a true strategic transformation partner. (See Exhibit 3.)

All the while, HR must keep pace with the organization and operate with agility as the transformation unfolds. HR’s expanded role will require a new set of capabilities. For example, frequent product and strategy shifts will call for regular upgrades to the organization structure. HR should work with line-of-business leaders to decide how the organization needs to adapt and then help orchestrate the process—with the expectation that the organization design will soon need to be upgraded again. Similarly, in the more volatile environment of a transformation, strategic workforce planning becomes more impor- tant—and more difficult. HR must take the lead in assessing and anticipating emerging skills gaps and in developing strategies to meet future needs for talent.

Some companies have well-estab- lished ideas about their overall direction and sense of purpose; these companies can focus primarily on short-term performance and delay setting a more visionary agenda. Other companies are tired of short- term thinking and constant cuts and need a more compelling story about where the new CEO intends to lead the company. In all cases, however, it is critical for the CEO to speak with authenticity and a sense of urgency.

This means immediately kicking off the rapid, no-regret moves that will deliver impact within 3 to 12 months, creating and enabling initiative teams, and setting up the overall governance and change management pro- gram for the transformation. (For more on this phase of transformation, see the chapter “Funding the Journey.”) Once these measures are underway, there is a real risk of prematurely declaring victory and moving on to other priorities, which will all but ensure the failure of the transformation effort.

These initiatives are also harder to staff and implement, and they call for managing interdependencies across functions and business units. As a result, companies often benefit from stepping back again to adjust their overall strategy and operating model. This does not need to be a broad strategy-planning exercise.

That change clarified Last, leaders need to make performance improvements sustainable. Many organizations that deliver good results during the transformation have a tough time sustaining their hard-won performance improvements after the transformation is over. The goal of every CEO should be to achieve success with the transformation program and then maintain it well beyond that point.

To deliver a fundamental change in performance at an accelerated pace, leaders need not only to define and articulate the vision but also to clearly articulate strategic priorities, set the transformation ambition and milestones, and hold employees accountable for results through regular checkpoints. Still, while strong directive leadership is necessary, in the era of always- on transformation it is not sufficient: it fails to provide the motivation required for sustained performance and the new ways of thinking needed to develop fundamentally better ways of working. Instead, leaders need to develop a more balanced “transformational leadership” approach that is both directive and inclusive. (See Exhibit 2.)

Many things are important to the success of a transformation, but nothing is more important than leadership. The role that leaders play evolves throughout the transformation—from defining the ambition to energizing the organization, preparing and launching the transforma- tion, and then driving and sustaining it. Succeeding in this essential role means adopting the right approach to leadership and being directive and inclusive.

What is the right mix of skills, attitudes and behaviors, approach- es, and tools? The good news is that there is growing recognition of the need for change done right. Many boards have appointed CEOs with that explicit charter, and almost all CEOs recognize the need to take even successful enterprises to new levels of performance.

To launch detailed discussions of the combined organization’s brand values and the behav- iors needed to support them, it held four sessions a year for the top 300 managers in its retail and IT operations. At the first session, the CEO himself explicitly laid out the expected behaviors. There was also a full day of interactive training for the top 1,000 managers, distributed among carefully orchestrated workshop groups of 60, to translate behaviors into practical realities. These sessions included development of an individual plan for each manager. Over the next six months, repeated training sessions drove home the big change messages and engaged middle managers in determining what the organization should keep doing, start doing, and stop doing. In the sessions, managers were provided with information, training, and tools that would ensure that messages cascaded down to junior managers and employees.

And they likely have to work with the leaders they already have, regardless of how capable those leaders are. There is no time to wait until conditions are perfect: change has to happen in the next four to six months—not the year to three years it can take for major leadership development efforts to work. The key question is: How do we best support the personnel we have? The answer to that question is rooted in the extent to which each leader truly “owns” the change agenda—and is seen to own it. Each leader should be continually aligned with his or her peers; the alignment must be palpable, visible, and evident to all in the way the entire manage- ment team communicates and embodies change, doing so in unison. And it should go without saying that all the leaders should have the skills and knowledge to manage change effectively and to pick lieuten- ants and key team members who can augment their efforts.

The moment that senior managers are perceived as merely paying lip service to the change efforts, those efforts are doomed. An effective change champion models sponsorship of the effort, enables employees to achieve the declared goals, and drives accountability for the outcomes. (See Exhibit 3.) Executional Certainty. More often than not, executional certainty is the preferred starting point for many conversations about change manage- ment—probably because it feels the most concrete and actionable. But the conversation almost always winds its way around and among the other Change Delta elements. The insistence on executional certainty diverges from traditional approaches to change management. Executional certainty comprises several major activities, all of which are sharply focused on results. It is tied to another essential of change management: establishing a gover- nance structure with clear accountabilities.

The underlying building block for this approach is an element that BCG terms the “initiative roadmap.” (A transformation program can have many initiatives, each of which can have several roadmaps.) The roadmap is categorically not a project plan covering a list of discrete tasks. Its purpose is to tell the story of the change initiative in such a way that executives can, on the basis of monthly updates, easily understand what is happening and make adjustments to ensure ultimate on-time value delivery. Roadmaps are made up of a number of milestones—in most cases, 15 to 25 are most effective—along with time frames, financial and operational metrics, and clear accountabilities.", "metadata": {"source_file": "BCG-Transformation-Nov-2016.pdf", "chunk_index": 133, "total_chunks": 251, "timestamp": "2026-02-04T07:47:49.871138"}}

Equally important: individuals and teams—and eventually the whole organization—steadi- ly build confidence not only in the potential success of the transforma- tion effort but also in their individual and collective ability to identify, launch, manage, and succeed at change at any time. Most important, an initiative roadmap articulates the key risks of and lead indicators for delivering the financial and operational impacts; it ensures that these are tested at critical points, and it signals when and how financial and operational outcomes will be triggered. Conventional change efforts typically have overall financial and operational goals, but the roadmap approach of tying such goals to individual milestones proves to be a far more successful way to achieve the promised value. Furthermore, linking measurable KPIs to milestones means that red flags will appear much earlier than in typical implementation exercises.

Bad news becomes good news: as the roadmap owner updates the roadmap, which typically occurs monthly, flagging an item in red signals an opportunity to act in time to ensure delivery of desired results. Typically, red indicates failure, but that’s not necessarily so when effective early-warning indicators and financial goals are tied to milestones. 84 The Boston Consulting Group Of course, not every milestone can be defined in such quantitative terms. Typically, only 20% to 30% of milestones have impacts attached to them. To help gauge the robustness of each roadmap, truly change-capa- ble companies use formal rigor-testing processes.

(See Flipping the Odds for Successful Reorganization, BCG Focus, April 2012.) Overall, engagement is especially important when it comes to key supporters—and skeptics. The process of identifying and prioritizing stakeholders by their level of support for the change effort and their degree of influence in the organization promotes targeted engagement.

When senior leaders feel that they are communicating about three times as much as they ever thought they would need to, they are probably hitting it right. Moreover, it is really important to communicate in small, interactive group settings. The hard facts of change—why, what, when, who, and, most important, what is in it for each individual—are the essential components of the conversation, to be sure.

In most cases, a steering committee comprising some or all of the senior team of leaders likely to be affected by the program is in place.

Change is created and delivered by line managers and their teams, but this happens effectively only when accountability is made explicit using robust governance structures and when the managers are armed with the information they need to facilitate timely decisions and actions.

He was one year into a large-scale transformation that was focused on growth through a shift into premium products. The company had invested millions of dollars to develop an innovative product that warranted higher prices. The early results had been promis- ing: initial sales were strong. However, the transformation was wrapping up, and the CEO’s attention was drawn to other challenges: the company had begun to revert to its old ways.

One successful product would not be enough to keep the business on track. Had the company invested millions to achieve only temporary results? This predicament is all too familiar. Many transformations fail to deliver because companies focus too much on the finish line and not enough on the capabilities that they need to build and strengthen in order to get there and—most important—to stay there. By “capability,” we mean an ingrained ability to do something well in a way that improves business performance. For example, a company could launch a transformation to improve its R&D performance, develop a new digital service, or change business models from wholesale to retail. Each of these transformations requires new, specific capabilities that the company needs to build—or acquire—in order to execute the transformation and sustain its benefits. BCG contends that, in fact, lasting transformations hinge on capabilities. Identifying and developing the requisite capabilities can mean the difference between a successful, sustained transformation and a short- term effort whose results quickly fade.", "metadata": {"source_file": "BCG-Transformation-Nov-2016.pdf", "chunk_index": 157, "total_chunks": 251, "timestamp": "2026-02-04T07:47:49.872265"}}

Companies must address all aspects of the target capability by applying a comprehensive definition. They must follow a systematic development approach and make sure that leaders are engaged and have committed their support. Where Do Companies Go Wrong? In many organizations, the approach to capabilities falls short for several reasons. First, as in the case of the CEO described earlier in this chapter, some leaders fail to recognize the importance of the target capabilities and, therefore, do not think about systematically incorporating them into the transformation itself. Second, building capabilities generally requires coordination across functions and business units. For example, developing a robust digital capability might require new talent (supported by HR), new tools (IT), new processes (operations), and new governance (leadership). In many companies, it can be difficult to bring these groups together in a coordinated effort and even harder to get them to see the big picture.", "metadata": {"source_file": "BCG-Transformation-Nov-2016.pdf", "chunk_index": 158, "total_chunks": 251, "timestamp": "2026-02-04T07:47:49.872309"}}

Third, acquiring the new capabilities might represent a huge leap into the unknown. A company in a process-heavy industry such as mining might find it reasonably easy to develop lean capabilities to make its production processes more efficient. But it might struggle to implement a new digital capability that requires upgrades to employee skills, technology, and other aspects of the organization. The biggest obstacle, however, is that new capabilities call for fundamental changes in behaviors—the ways that employees, managers, and executives work on a daily basis. And behavioral change is hard. Without a systematic and explicit approach, compa- nies can, at best, change these behaviors only superficially and temporarily. Once the transformation process is over and attention shifts to the next priority, employees can easily revert to their old ways of working, and the improvements of the transformation disappear. 98 The Boston Consulting Group A Comprehensive Definition To address these challenges, companies need to start with a comprehen- sive definition.", "metadata": {"source_file": "BCG-Transformation-Nov-2016.pdf", "chunk_index": 159, "total_chunks": 251, "timestamp": "2026-02-04T07:47:49.872348"}}

The company could change behaviors by systematically incorporating all four elements: - Competencies could include, for example, knowledge about which promotions are best suited to specific retail channels, the analytical skills required to build a promotion strategy, and the belief that promotion decisions should be driven by data. - Tools could include an analytics system that collects more accurate point-of-sale data, customers’ mobile-browsing and purchasing history, and other information for generating insights for sales and marketing leaders.", "metadata": {"source_file": "BCG-Transformation-Nov-2016.pdf", "chunk_index": 161, "total_chunks": 251, "timestamp": "2026-02-04T07:47:49.872442"}}

It’s important to note that these elements are not always weighted equally. Certain capabilities emphasize some elements more than others. Nevertheless, a strong capability does incorporate some piece of all four elements in order to fundamentally reshape behaviors.

In support of these strategic objectives, the company conducted internal and external interviews and a benchmarking analysis and came up with 102 The Boston Consulting Group Exhibit 2 | Ten Practices for Systematically Building Capabilities Ruthlessly prioritize the critical few capabilities that will deliver the 1 greatest value. 2 Assess the gaps in all facets of the critical capabilities. 3 Align leaders on the overall process. 4 Design each capability, addressing all four components.", "metadata": {"source_file": "BCG-Transformation-Nov-2016.pdf", "chunk_index": 166, "total_chunks": 251, "timestamp": "2026-02-04T07:47:49.872727"}}

To prioritize them, the company ranked the capabilities according to two dimensions: the relative importance of each capability to the company’s strategy and the difficulty of imple- mentation. Management decided that the capabilities that were impor- tant to the strategy and easy to implement would require relatively less direct oversight, which—later in the transformation—could be passed on to line managers. Conversely, capabilities that were important but hardest to implement would require a different approach. Those would require significant time, energy, resources, and commitment from leadership, so the company opted to create teams dedicated to building these as part of the transformation program.

Many companies err at this stage, thinking of capabilities as single-dimensional attributes rather than considering all four dimensions of each capability. The gap analysis helps organizations start to map out the effort that will be required during the transforma- tion. Align leaders on the overall process. Senior leaders at the company need to understand not only the target capabilities but also the full scope of the process required to develop them. Executives must be prepared to invest time and energy to see that process through. And the process can extend over a long period during which the executives will likely face demands on their time and attention in overseeing the transformation itself.

This requires recognizing that capabilities are not addressed only through training. (See the sidebar “An Auto Manufacturer Builds Digital Capabilities.”) Assemble a cross-functional team with the necessary expertise and perspectives. During the design process, a cross-functional team can ensure that critical aspects don’t fall through the cracks. Such teams include representatives from, for instance, HR, IT, and finance.

To help leaders prioritize, we provide the following guidelines. Know what you don’t know. Capability building can be especially difficult when the target capability resides outside the leadership team’s expertise. Leaders are naturally drawn to areas they know well and to which they can quickly add value, but transformations don’t always offer that luxury. For example, the leaders of a company that lacks first-hand digital experience but needs to become better at launching new digital initia- tives might need to push themselves in ways that are unsettling. For this reason, it’s critical that they understand their own limits and become creative and resilient in building capabilities. One approach is to rely on experts, perhaps hiring from companies that already have the required capabilities. Mentorship and coaching can help.

In sum, by doubling down on the capabilities needed to execute the transformation, the company was able to grow through stronger sales in the premium segment and to generate sustainable gains. Many companies that launch transformations focus doggedly on demon- strating outcomes. That approach is understandable, but because it doesn’t address the underlying capabilities needed to achieve and sustain the outcomes, it’s shortsighted and will likely fail. Regardless of industry or type of transformation, capabilities are critical elements in improving performance and sustaining results, ultimately in the form of increased value creation.

Together, these steps can help management teams determine where to start, how to manage the process, and how to generate sustainable progress with their digital transformations. Educate Companies seeking to pursue digital often proceed from very different starting points, with different capabilities, circumstances, and degrees of ambition. Some will be able to leverage digital technology to fully transform their operations, processes, and business model. Others may need only to increase efficiency by reengineering certain business processes. The first step for a leader considering a digital transformation is to educate himself or herself on the company’s current use of digital. This need not be a comprehensive, exhaustive process. As with all digital endeavors, speed and initiative are critical. Moving forward on the basis of partial information is far better than trying to complete a precise assessment before taking a first step. There are several objectives at this stage: Digital Transformation 117 - Expose the leadership team and the organization more broadly to the opportunities and threats posed by digital technologies and digital attackers.", "metadata": {"source_file": "BCG-Transformation-Nov-2016.pdf", "chunk_index": 189, "total_chunks": 251, "timestamp": "2026-02-04T07:47:49.873792"}}

At this point, it is helpful to focus on digital use cases where simple prototypes can clearly demonstrate the power of digital. These opportu- nities may not be the biggest or the most urgent, but they should serve to make digital’s potential more tangible. In addition to charting the current and potential use of digital, a company planning a digital transformation needs to assess its current readiness across a variety of dimensions—for example, by undergoing a digital health check. This includes assessing the availability and quality of a company’s data, as well as the company’s IT architecture (including the degree to which it is digital ready), capabilities in innovation, and overall culture and readiness for change.", "metadata": {"source_file": "BCG-Transformation-Nov-2016.pdf", "chunk_index": 190, "total_chunks": 251, "timestamp": "2026-02-04T07:47:49.873846"}}

Crystallize The second step is to crystallize a plan for how to move forward, along with a potential portfolio of digital initiatives. In the agile spirit of digital, this should not be a drawn-out effort. Big organizations are accustomed to managing large-scale, multiyear projects with fixed timelines and set budgets. It’s not uncommon for an enterprise-resource- planning migration project to take five to ten years from start to finish. But in today’s fast-paced digital economy, such a model is not just outdated—it’s potentially fatal to the organization. To survive, compa- nies need to work and make decisions more rapidly than ever before. The portfolio of potential digital efforts should include initiatives for reshaping the customer experience; reimagining products, services, and 118 The Boston Consulting Group business models; and reengineering business processes.

Radical process reengineering demands careful strategic workforce planning. In the digital age, such transformation can increase a company’s productivity—but only if the company quickly finds or trains candidates to fill new job profiles that may affect a substantial part of its total workforce. (See Man and Machine in Industry 4.0: How Will Technology Transform the Industrial Workforce Through 2025?, BCG Focus, September 2015.) Without active management of work- force issues, fundamental reengineering will almost certainly stall or even fail. A leading North American bank offers a good example of the reengi- neering of business processes.

Unlike in the typical development model, in which IT teams deliver specific functionality (creating a button here or a search box there), the bank’s cross-functional teams had the freedom to design a product as they saw fit—and supervisors evaluated them on their ability to meet their stated business objective.

Digital Transformation 121 Accelerate Once a company has crystallized a plan and a clear set of priorities, the next step is to accelerate the digital transformation. The goal of this phase is to use an agile approach to launch pilots for the initiatives identified during the “educate” and “crystallize” phases. At this point, speed and agility are crucial. The digital transformation, when done right, is not a monolithic endeavor. Rather, multiple projects run simulta- neously on parallel tracks. Rather than clinging to the traditional, linear approach to rolling out new initiatives, companies should quickly bring new ideas to market, gather customer feedback, and refine the concept iteratively. Many accomplish this by means of the minimum viable product (MVP) process of prototyping.

That allows the company to minimize its investment, test the new products and services in the real world (instead of in artificial settings such as focus groups), and refine them using customer feedback. For example, the initial versions of apps and online stores are often quite basic, with new features and functions added over time, depending on how customers use the products. A North American pharmaceutical company, for example, adopted a prototyping approach to accelerate digital change. It started by testing initiatives such as search engine optimization and targeted training in the sales and marketing organization.

Scale Up and Transform Once the company has identified its most important digital priorities and accelerated a number of initiatives, it faces the challenge of scaling 122 The Boston Consulting Group up the successful ventures and transforming the organization. Several levers are available to accomplish this. The right one depends on the company’s level of ambition, the strength of its existing digital capabili- ties, and external market factors (primarily, the degree of disruption posed by new digital competitors). Building capabilities is a critical step that enables companies to develop new ways of working, new business models, and other building blocks of digital transformation.

Transformation in Emerg- ing Markets E merging markets have driven growth for many multinational corporations (MNCs) for years, and they will continue to do so. But these are turbulent times, as commodity prices plunge, currencies are devalued, and equity markets gyrate. The profitability of many MNCs’ operations is already under attack, and future performance will be challenged by slower macroeconomic growth, increased costs, and heightened competition from local companies, which are rapidly gaining scale, experience, and capabili- ties. To reduce these pressures, MNCs will have to focus much more on improving their competitiveness through constant produc- tivity gains.", "metadata": {"source_file": "BCG-Transformation-Nov-2016.pdf", "chunk_index": 224, "total_chunks": 251, "timestamp": "2026-02-04T07:47:49.875346"}}

Shifting the emphasis to include profitability requires implementing process disci- pline, leveraging scale, and instituting behaviors that focus on constantly improving efficiency. Such changes are not easily achieved. For many MNCs, a fundamental transformation will be necessary, executed market by market. The Transformation Imperative The shifts taking place in emerging markets are big, structural, and long term. As macroeconomic growth slows and competition rises, improved productivity is a critical capability that will allow MNCs to continue to increase revenue and profit and gain share. Our MNC clients today talk continually of the need to make operations in emerging markets as productive as those in developed markets.

Shifting focus away from growth alone toward a combination of growth and rapid, steady productivity gains requires changes in both strategy and execution. It also usually requires a shift in the way that both global and local management thinks about goals, processes, and governance. Many MNCs will have to undertake a process of transformation in emerging markets. As we have discussed throughout this publication, transformations are not just for troubled companies; they have become necessary interventions in many, if not most, corporations.

Moreover, while many companies get their broad globalization strategies right, they come up short on execution in individual markets. Issues related to execution were where our research found the biggest gaps between leaders and laggards. MNCs should move quickly, but they should also advance with care.

A growth bias was vital to capturing share in markets that were expanding at breakneck speeds.

Their com- pensation costs are also higher because higher labor productivity only partially offsets higher pay packages. The companies use these insights as the basis for restructuring their local activities to address competitive weaknesses. Another manifestation of this shift will be developing new ways to think about portfolio management. Many companies have developed a broad portfolio of offerings in emerging markets, often with individual prod- ucts tailored for individual countries.", "metadata": {"source_file": "BCG-Transformation-Nov-2016.pdf", "chunk_index": 231, "total_chunks": 251, "timestamp": "2026-02-04T07:47:49.875646"}}

This approach has been a big driver of growth, but a tougher outlook now requires a different kind of product portfolio management.

They are systematically using target costing to further ensure competitiveness, often setting targets of 30% to 50% less than that of the previous prod- uct. And they are rethinking how they can adapt offerings from one emerging market to others and thus gain scale advantages. 142 The Boston Consulting Group Funding the Journey with a Leaner Organization.

Some companies are even starting to use emerging markets as pilots for completely new definitions of processes, especially in the area of digitization.

(See the sidebar “Go-to- Market Approaches Continue to Be Highly Localized.”) Establishing the Right Teams, Platforms, and Behaviors. Most companies will need to redirect the behaviors of their local teams. The priority in the past was to gear up for growth by investing big in people development and potential needs; now, though, companies now should apply a tight focus on individual performance and accountability for costs.

In the future, training might have to de-emphasize formal classroom-type sessions in favor of on-the-job coaching. Perhaps most important is rethinking the role of both expatriate and local executives in management. Expatriates in emerging markets should take the role of team builders rather than line managers. This happens in many companies, but most can go further, making expatri- ates accountable for developing strong local managers by actually transferring skills and know-how rather than simply meeting short-term KPIs.
