Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) continue to push the boundaries of what is possible in marketing and sales. And now, with the ongoing step-change evolution of generative AI (gen AI), we’re seeing the use of open-source platforms penetrating to the sales frontlines, along with rising investment by sales-tech players in gen AI innovations. Given the accelerating complexity and speed of doing business in a digital-first world, these technologies are becoming essential tools. Our research suggests that a fifth of current sales-team functions could be automated. Inevitably, this will impact how you operate—and how you connect with and serve your customers.

T...", "content": "This is the great power of generative AI, or gen AI: it utilizes algorithms to generate new content—writing, images, or audio—from training data. To do this, gen AI uses deep-learning models called foundation models (FMs). FMs are pre-trained on massive datasets and the algorithms they support are adaptable to a wide variety of downstream tasks, including content generation. Gen AI can be trained, for example, to predict the next word in a string of words and can generalize that ability to multiple text-generation tasks, such as writing articles, jokes, or code. In contrast, “traditional” AI is trained on a single task with human supervision, using data specific to that task; it can be fine-tuned to reach high precision, but must be retrained for each new use case. Thus gen AI represents an enormous step change in power, sophistication, and utility—and a fundamental shift in our relationship to artificial intelligence. 1 Nestor Maslej et al., “The AI Index 2023 annual report,” AI Index Steering Committee, Institute for Human-Centered AI, Stanford University, April 2023.", "metadata": {"source_file": "ai-powered-marketing-and-sales-reach-new-heights-with-generative-ai.pdf", "chunk_index": 4, "total_chunks": 17, "timestamp": "2026-02-04T07:41:20.146709"}}

The rise of AI, and particularly gen AI, has potential for impact in three areas of marketing and sales: customer experience (CX), growth, and productivity. For example, in CX, hyper-personalized content and offerings can be based on individual customer behavior, persona, and purchase history. Growth can be accelerated by leveraging AI to jumpstart top-line performance, giving sales teams the right analytics and customer insights to capture demand. Additionally, AI can boost sales effectiveness and performance by offloading and automating many mundane sales activities, freeing up capacity to spend more time with customers and prospective customers (while reducing cost to serve). In all these actions, personalization is key.", "metadata": {"source_file": "ai-powered-marketing-and-sales-reach-new-heights-with-generative-ai.pdf", "chunk_index": 5, "total_chunks": 17, "timestamp": "2026-02-04T07:41:20.146773"}}

Its algorithms then enable businesses to create personalized outreach content, easily and at scale. Instead of spending time researching and creating audience segments, a marketer can leverage gen AI’s algorithms to identify segments with unique traits that may have been overlooked in existing customer data.
