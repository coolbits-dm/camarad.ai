One is because customers don’t just expect more, the expectations themselves also change quickly, radically shifting profits. The other is that executives face an increasingly complex landscape of technologies, methodologies, and both regulatory and compliance pressures to ensure that new processes are standardized and traceable. This sea change for both B2B and B2C businesses is fundamentally transforming what “services” means. Our research suggests that as much as 45 percent of employee activities can be automated by adopting current technologies. That is calling into question how businesses work, build skills, and deliver customer experiences. This reality is particularly important given the high-stakes nature of today’s digital environment. Our research has revealed a “power curve” where the top quintile of performers capture more than 90 percent of the economic profit (see Exhibit). The 24 companies that make up the top 1 percent of our sample earn—astonishingly—the same as the next 87 companies combined.

Confusion about what the primary “axis of change” is—from customer expectations to technology—as well as which combination of capabilities to build and in what sequence, has been the primary culprit. Yet we know that companies across industries can successfully make the leap when they put in place a sound strategy and commit to making a specific set of big moves: accessing new markets or capabilities through mergers and acquisitions, investing in capabilities and value- creating activities at significant scale, aggressively allocating resources to those capabilities and activities, and radically improving productivity.

This can make it easier to deliver incremental gains within individual units, but the overall impact is most often underwhelming and hard to sustain. Tangible benefits to customers—in the form of faster turnaround or better service—can get lost due to hand-offs between units. These become black holes in the process, often involving multiple back-and-forth steps and long lag times. As a result, it’s common to see individual functions reporting that they’ve achieved notable operational improvements, but customer satisfaction and overall costs remain unchanged.

Journeys—both customer-facing and end-to-end internal processes—are therefore the preferred organizing principle. Transitioning to the next-generation operating model starts with classifying and mapping key journeys. At a bank, for example, customer-facing journeys can typically be divided into seven categories: signing up for a new account; setting up the account and getting it running; adding a new product or account; using the account; receiving and managing statements; making changes to accounts; and resolving problems. Journeys can vary by product/service line and DIGITAL MCKINSEY 9 customer segment.

DIGITAL MCKINSEY 11 Guidelines for implementing these levers In considering which levers to use and how to apply them, it’s important to think in a holistic way, keeping the entire journey in mind.

This often breeds a false complacency, insulating the organizations from the learnings that would otherwise drive them to higher performance because it is “already under way” or “has been tried”. Having something already under way is a truism: everyone has something under way in these kinds of domains, but it is the companies that press to the limit that reap the rewards. Executives need to be vigilant, challenge their people, and resist the easy answer. In the case of analytics, for example, maxing out the potential requires using sophisticated modeling techniques and data sources in a concerted, cross-functional effort, while also ensuring that front-line employees then execute in a top-flight way on the insights generated by the models. 2.

However, the best results come when the levers can build on each other. That means, in practice, figuring out which one depends on the successful implementation of another. Systematic analysis is necessary to guide decision making. Some institutions have started by outlining an in-house versus outsource strategy rooted in a fundamental question: “What is core to our value proposition?” Key considerations include whether the activities involved are strategic or confer competitive advantage or whether sensitive data or regulatory constraints are present. The next step is to use a structured set of questions to evaluate how much opportunity there is to apply each of the remaining levers and then to estimate the potential impact of each lever on costs and customer experience. This exercise results in each lever being assigned an overall score to help develop a preliminary point of view on which sequence to use in implementing the levers.", "metadata": {"source_file": "introducing-the-next-gen-operating-model.pdf", "chunk_index": 19, "total_chunks": 239, "timestamp": "2026-02-04T07:48:01.884798"}}

Finally, the levers should interact with each other to provide a multiplier effect. For example, one bank only saw significant impact from its lean and digitization efforts in the mortgage application journey after both efforts were working in tandem.

These maps include estimates for each journey of how much costs can be reduced (measured in terms of both head count and financial metrics) and how much the customer experience can be improved. Companies find heat maps a valuable way to engage the leadership team in strategic discussions about which approaches and capabilities to use and how to prioritize them.

Many companies have relied on Lean to improve FNOL call-center performance. One leading North American insurer, however, discovered it could unlock even more value by sequencing the buildout of three additional capabilities, based on the progress it had already made with Lean: Digitization.

Many organizations simply take a “problem view”—treating internal processes as a cost that needs to be reduced, and looking for customer pain points that need to be eliminated. That’s a good place to start, but if it’s the only view, it misses out on the idea of creating additional customer value. One insurance company invested time in deepening its understanding of the distress customers suffer when they have an automobile accident and make a claim. The insurer found customers were extremely dissatisfied with the lengthy process of filing a claim over the phone, especially the number of back-and-forth calls with the loss adjuster and the lack of transparency on the status of the claim. The insurer used this understanding of customer pain points to create a new mobile app that enables a claim to be filed within a couple of minutes, sends messages to update customers on the status of their claim, and provides real-time processing and cash payout.", "metadata": {"source_file": "introducing-the-next-gen-operating-model.pdf", "chunk_index": 30, "total_chunks": 239, "timestamp": "2026-02-04T07:48:01.885332"}}

While these are still early days for the start- up, it is declaring speeds for processing claims in matters of seconds.

Most organizations manage operations, track performance, and measure customer satisfaction along functional lines. Yet the best way to tackle customer experience is to follow it from the customer’s point of view, along a journey that cuts across functions and channels. That’s because customers frequently use multiple channels to interact with their service provider, and need multiple interactions to complete a transaction. Imagine you are a customer trying to resolve an issue. You may need to visit a retail outlet, phone a call center, visit a website, use an app, or any combination of these.", "metadata": {"source_file": "introducing-the-next-gen-operating-model.pdf", "chunk_index": 32, "total_chunks": 239, "timestamp": "2026-02-04T07:48:01.885415"}}

Resolving problems is an area that many customer-facing businesses struggle to get right.

When businesses are trying to see journeys as customers see them, it can be hard to shake off a frame of mind that revolves around internal processes, structures, and KPIs. It may take a deliberate effort to stop thinking “this change might be difficult to implement” or “that cost has to be reduced” and start thinking what the customer wants instead. Small changes can help to create the right mind-set, such as the insurance company’s decision to stop referring to customers by their claims numbers. Describing journeys from the customer’s perspective—“I wait in line” or “I receive a bill”—is also helpful in exploring what can go wrong and how to put it right.

The operating model of the future combines digital technologies and process-improvement capabilities in an integrated, sequenced way to drastically improve customer journeys and internal processes. Lean management has already played a significant role in putting in place processes, capabilities, and tools to improve how businesses operate. But the digital age has increased both the opportunities for businesses who know how to react and the difficulty of getting it right. For one thing, tasks performed by humans are more complex, whether it’s accessing information in multiple formats from multiple sources or responding to changing market and customer dynamics at ever-increasing speeds. And as an increasing number of tasks become automated or are taken over by cognitive-intelligence capabilities, companies will need to take many of the lessons learned from lean management and update them.", "metadata": {"source_file": "introducing-the-next-gen-operating-model.pdf", "chunk_index": 47, "total_chunks": 239, "timestamp": "2026-02-04T07:48:01.886148"}}

We have found that companies that successfully build next-generation operating models do two things well. They focus on putting in place the building blocks that drive change across the organization, and they select a transformation path that suits their situation.

These organizations are also becoming nimble in how they build skills across their teams by making “anchor hires” for key roles, setting up rotational and “train the trainer” programs, and committing to ongoing (often weekly) capability building and training for key roles. Many insurers, for example, are dismantling traditional claims and underwriting units and reconstructing them to embed subject-matter experts such as lawyers and nurses into service groups.

Building Block #2: Flexible and modular architecture, infrastructure, and software delivery Technology is a core element of any next-generation operating model, and it needs to support a much faster and more flexible deployment of products and services. However, companies often have trouble understanding how to implement these new technologies alongside legacy systems or are hampered by outdated systems that move far too slowly.

Defining the path for your organization There is no one way to develop a next-generation operating model. It depends on a company’s existing capabilities, desired speed of transformation, level of executive commitment, and economic pressure. We have seen four paths that leading companies take to drive their transformation, though organizations often move to a different path as their capabilities mature.

It introduced next-gen analytics, focused on customer experience rather than technology, and drove the mobile interface. Staying largely separate from the main business, the outpost created a buzz around innovation, attracted better talent, and repatriated many of its creations into the broader organization. This path works well when there is limited alignment among executives on the importance and value of transformation, a need to move very quickly in response to market pressures, and significant legacy culture challenges to overcome.

This model can also make it harder to build and share capabilities across the organization since the skills developed are specific to the business unit.

Top-performing companies also develop a clear vision of the entire customer ecosystem, understanding relevant interactions that extend beyond the core journey the company controls.

As Steve Jobs said, “[Design is] not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.” To design a compelling customer journey, companies must enlist everyone who has an impact on any part of a customer’s journey, not just people with the word “design” in their title. In particular, operational and IT groups should be involved. Companies need to not merely map out customer touchpoints but also implement changes that must occur in the background to deliver a superior journey.

From addressing issues in the customer journey to completely rethinking the customer experience Many companies spend a lot of time improving their current customer journeys. This can lead to incremental cost reductions and quality enhancements. But such an approach may also cause companies to narrow their horizons and blind them to better overall solutions. True reinvention requires taking a hard look at journeys from the customer’s perspective to find the pivotal insight around which a new journey should revolve. The focus is addressing customer needs, not improving a process. Bringing in people who are not normally involved in the process can be a great way to encourage fresh thinking.

Creating responsive and adaptive customer experiences requires the entire organization to be agile. Making that change begins with putting in place new governance standards and ways of working. Product managers responsible for developing new offerings, for example, need the authority to make decisions quickly and to hold staff from functional groups accountable. This means metrics and incentives also need to be adjusted to focus on end-to-end rather than functional objectives. Instead of asking for detailed business cases, companies should fund projects the way venture- capital firms fund start-ups: making a number of small bets at first and providing more money if DIGITAL MCKINSEY 37 early results are promising.

The organizational and leadership implications are enormous: leaders from the C-suite to the front line will need to redefine jobs and processes so that their organizations can take advantage of the automation potential that is distributed across them. And the opportunities extend far beyond labor savings.

What follows here are four interim findings elaborating on the core insight that the road ahead is less about automating individual jobs wholesale than it is about automating the activities within occupations and redefining roles and processes. 1. The automation of activities These preliminary findings are based on data for the US labor market. We structured our analysis around roughly 2,000 individual work activities5 and assessed the requirements for each of these activities against 18 different capabilities that potentially could be automated (Exhibit 1). 3 This initiative builds on earlier McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) work describing a range of disruptive technologies, which could multiply the capacity of companies to automate physical and intellectual tasks.

In some cases, that performance has been demonstrated in a commercially available product and in others as part of a research project. 5 Our analysis used “detailed work activities” as defined by O*NET, a program sponsored by the US Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration.

The bottom line is that 45 percent of work activities could be automated using already demonstrated technology.

The magnitude of automation potential reflects the speed with which advances in artificial intelligence and its variants, such as machine learning, are challenging our assumptions about what is automatable. It’s no longer the case that only routine, codifiable activities are candidates for automation and that activities requiring “tacit” knowledge or experience that is difficult to translate into task specifications are immune to automation.

The redefinition of jobs and business processes According to our analysis, fewer than 5 percent of occupations can be entirely automated using current technology. However, about 60 percent of occupations could have 30 percent or more of their constituent activities automated.

As roles and processes get redefined, the economic benefits of automation will extend far beyond labor savings.

These include analyzing reports and data to inform operational decisions, preparing staff assignments, and reviewing status reports. Conversely, there are many lower-wage occupations, such as home health aides, landscapers, and maintenance workers, where only a very small percentage of activities could be automated with technology available today (Exhibit 2). 4.

Financial advisors, for example, might spend less time analyzing clients’ financial situations and more time understanding their needs and explaining creative options. Interior designers could spend less time taking measurements, developing illustrations, and ordering materials and more time developing innovative design concepts based on clients’ desires. 6 In addition to analyzing the relationship between automatability and compensation levels, the inclusion of wages allows us to compare the potential costs to implement automation with labor costs, which inherently reflect supply, demand, and elasticity dynamics.", "metadata": {"source_file": "introducing-the-next-gen-operating-model.pdf", "chunk_index": 123, "total_chunks": 239, "timestamp": "2026-02-04T07:48:01.889699"}}

How to get started on your IPA transformation IPA does not require a significant infrastructure investment since it addresses the presentation layer of information systems. RPA software, for example, sits on top of existing systems, enabling it to be implemented to achieve rapid returns without changing the IT back end.

Such clarity allows business leaders to evaluate and align on the approaches and capabilities to implement to drive the operating model. In many cases IPA has an important— even dominant—role in driving the change, but its greatest value comes when companies understand how it can work with the other capabilities and approaches in the operating model. Automation is coming, and now is the time to define the art of the possible and apply it strategically where it makes most sense. 2.

Start your IPA journey by rapidly creating an overview of current tasks and the resources and capabilities needed to carry them out.

The rapid returns from early pilots help to secure support from stakeholders and executive sponsors for a much deeper program to harness the potential achievable from a full IPA transformation. 4.

From bedrock to quicksand The threat to organizational health is plain. As we argue in “Agility: It rhymes with stability” (McKinsey Quarterly, December 2015, McKinsey.com), the hallmark of an agile age is the ability to be stable and dynamic, allowing incumbents to make the most of their big-company advantages, while simultaneously keeping pace with quicker-moving disruptors. Like old masonry buildings— such as the Musée d’Orsay in Paris or the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco—that have new glass and steel added to their existing structures, today’s leading companies must integrate the contrasting elements of stability and speed to create a more functional, modern whole. McKinsey research shows that bedrock aspects of stability—workers’ roles and the processes that support them—are the first and fourth most important factors, respectively, differentiating agile companies from the rest.

It will force companies to figure out how to reassemble the remaining tasks into something that makes a new kind of sense, even as it reconceptualizes the very idea of what a job is. The early stages of these efforts may already be visible as organizations free highly specialized knowledge workers from mundane tasks. The most talented surgeons at one cardiac hospital, for example, perform only the heart surgery itself, while more junior staffers handle pre- and post-op procedures; a similar redesign has helped lawyers on the partner track and school administrators make the most of their scarcest skills.2 Once roles and tasks are sorted out, the newly constructed jobs that result must be reaggregated into some greater whole, or “box,” on the org chart.

No doubt, at this early juncture, many possibilities exist. One intriguing approach might work as follows: first split multifaceted jobs into discrete tasks, automating some and determining what can be done more effectively by humans. Then match those needs with the employees who can meet them, where they are, and when they’re available.3 Finally, introduce a market-clearing mechanism to tie everything together.", "metadata": {"source_file": "introducing-the-next-gen-operating-model.pdf", "chunk_index": 172, "total_chunks": 239, "timestamp": "2026-02-04T07:48:01.891971"}}

They may be more feasible now, though, thanks to digital workforce platforms—software layers that help executives allocate collections of workers’ skills against a wide array of projects and processes. Companies can deploy such a platform even as they lower overhead costs and improve their responsiveness and flexibility. These new platforms, as we will see, may provide a novel form of organizational structure, but they won’t restabilize the workforce in and of themselves. Companies must also be careful to account for the more permanent aspects of their employees’ working lives, such as the business segments they know best, their functional areas of expertise, and the geographies where they live.

From a technology-based point of view, it would seem that companies could thrive by standardizing on a single-speed enterprise architecture. But in our experience, the enterprise architecture will still need to be managed at different speeds to accommodate process and organizational requirements.

Emphasizing business capabilities So which business capabilities should be fast-tracked within the enterprise architecture? Typically the ones that involve direct interactions with customers and areas where quick changes are required to create competitive advantage. One global bank that successfully implemented a two- speed enterprise architecture determined that, apart from introducing new online applications through which customers could transfer funds or update their personal information, it would need to change the back-end systems that supported the creation or modification of customer data. It wasn’t just the front-end systems that got faster; back-end systems of record needed to become part of the fast architecture, too.

The retailer separated its product-information-management system into several modules, each of which could be updated at a different speed. Takeaways As two-speed models for enterprise architecture take hold, many companies are already seeing how they can be used to improve the customer experience and reduce risk. But the impact of the approach can be amplified when companies put business capabilities at the center of all decisions relating to the two-speed model.

This “enterprise customer-experience story” will be unique to the company and will distill its strategy, brand, and positioning into practical guidelines that together support the rest of the transformation.

DIGITAL MCKINSEY 107 But this is what it means to digitize at scale. Companies must resist two temptations. The first is to try to digitize each journey separately, which only recreates the internal silos that most organizations are trying to break apart. The second is to invest heavily in specific Internet or mobile-channel IT, which is usually unnecessary. Instead, once the company has identified the core journeys it will digitize, it should choose its IT components and its sequencing so that the IT architecture changes naturally as the journeys build on one another.

Such rapid adaptation represents a fundamental cultural shift for incumbents in almost every industry, and especially in heavily regulated fields in which perfectionism and caution are the default behaviors. First, the pressure for speed means companies must identify a new type of MVP (minimum viable product). They must describe a customer need accurately, without excess scope, and fulfill it efficiently, without excess complexity. And they must make a real change in their perspective. For example, digital’s speed alone is a huge advantage: a digital product providing only 80 percent of its analog counterpart’s features may still succeed simply by being 10 or 20 times faster.

Yet traditional measures of performance go only so far in supporting the new culture and work habits. First, the metrics themselves must typically change. Some measures, such as short-term return on investment, may in fact hamper the innovation that digitization requires by discouraging employees from taking risks. Other measures may impede collaboration. For example, an organization should abandon promotion metrics that emphasize the number of reports a manager has and instead reward those who reassign team members to high-growth businesses.

In addition, the institution tracked the talent funnel for each critical role to understand how many people were being identified, interviewed, and offered a position, and how many of them accepted. It identified low-performing areas of the talent funnel and constantly reworked practices to improve its hiring performance. Build “squads” of working teams. Success in a digital factory relies on the ability to staff a small group of people (generally 8 to 12) with the right set of complementary skills to work on a given project.

The core squad members belong to the digital factory but work with the business owners for the duration of the project. They should also connect frequently with other squads working on related projects to coordinate and account for the necessary handoffs. Model collaboration in your workspace. The space a business devotes to a digital factory matters. The company must create an environment that signals that the work done there will break new ground.

You can’t tell people they are going to reinvent your organization if they work in a place that shouts “business as usual.” One leading European bank devoted a full floor of its new office building to its digital factory and invested in creating a collaborative environment. Architects eliminated cabinets between work tables, adding movable panels that act as dividers between different teams and make it easy to introduce and access visual aids such as flowcharts and storyboards. They also created informal areas with couches, ping-pong tables, and eating spaces, all laid out to make it easy for people to relax, catch up with each other, and exchange information.

Any large company will have many digital-transformation projects on its to-do list, so it’s vital for top managers to agree on what comes first. Without that alignment, the journey becomes unmanageable. A team at one leading European bank developed a set of initial priorities and repeatedly iterated them with top management. At the end of the process, management agreed to a roadmap of 40 core customer journeys that were prioritized in line with their potential impact both on the bank’s business (such as P&L) and on its digital capabilities (such as automation).

Companies with agile cultures empower on-the-ground teams to make most decisions based on clear principles set at the top of the organization.

Making better leaders through digital The final shift is the furthest reaching: digital’s speed requires leaders and managers to develop much stronger day-to-day skills in working with their teams. Too often, even substantial behavior changes don’t last. That’s when digital actually becomes part of the solution. About two years after a top-to-bottom transformation, cracks began to show at a large North American property-and-casualty insurer. Competitors began to catch up as associate performance slipped. Managers and leaders reported high levels of stress and turnover. A detailed assessment found that the new practices leaders had adopted—the cycle of daily huddles, problem-solving sessions, and check-ins to confirm processes were working—were losing their punch. Leaders were paying too little attention to the quality of these interactions, which were becoming ritualized. Their people responded by investing less as well. Digital provided a way for leaders to recommit.", "metadata": {"source_file": "introducing-the-next-gen-operating-model.pdf", "chunk_index": 237, "total_chunks": 239, "timestamp": "2026-02-04T07:48:01.894990"}}

Master calendars let leaders prioritize their on-the- ground work with their teams over other interruptions. Redefined targets for each management tier are now measured on a daily basis. The resulting transparency has already increased engagement among managers, while raising retention rates for front-line associates. Organizations investing in human and digital capabilities can start by asking themselves several critical questions: - Do we really understand how customers interact with us now and how they want to in the future? - How can we give customers the experience they want, no matter which digital and human channels they use? - How can we speed our metabolism so we can uncover new opportunities for better performance? - Can our culture become flexible enough for us to collaborate effectively with our customers through constant change?
